# Health Data Clustering and Visualization

This project explores a large-scale health dataset containing over 300,000 records and 19 variables related to general health, medical history, lifestyle habits, and demographics. The main goal is to gain insight through data visualization, preprocessing, and clustering analysis.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Rows**: 308,855
- **Features**:
  - General_Health, Checkup, Exercise, Heart_Disease, Skin_Cancer, Other_Cancer
  - Depression, Diabetes, Arthritis, Sex, Age_Category, Height (cm), Weight (kg), BMI
  - Smoking_History, Alcohol_Consumption, Fruit_Consumption, Green_Vegetables_Consumption, FriedPotato_Consumption

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned the dataset
   - One hot encoding
   - Feature selection
   - Feature scalling

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Distribution of health-related features
   - Category-based plots (e.g., BMI by Age or Heart Disease by Smoking History)

3. **Clustering**
   - Applied K-Means clustering
